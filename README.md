## ⭐️ Key Features and Compliance Checklist

This project was developed to meet all mandatory Final Project Requirements, focusing on enhanced JavaScript functionality and robust design.

### I. Enhanced JavaScript Functionality (25 Points)

All core features leverage **Local Storage** for persistent data management.

| Requirement | Status | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication (Sign Up / Log In)** | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Full **Sign Up** and **Log In** system implemented. User data is stored in `localStorage`, and successful login redirects to a dedicated profile page. |
| **Saving Rating Information** | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Interactive user ratings and favorite selections are stored and retrieved from `localStorage` (`rating.js`, `favorites.js`). |
| **Form Validation** | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Comprehensive validation applied to all interactive forms, including checks for email format, password length/complexity, and required fields (`contactForm.js`). |
| **Search and Filtration** | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Functionality to search and filter content (e.g., by title/genre). Search results are saved in `localStorage` (`search.js`, `filtering.js`). |
| **Working Buttons** | ✅ **COMPLETED** | All buttons and interactive elements are fully functional (e.g., "Load More," interactive ratings). |

### II. Core Project Requirements
